# CupOfIce
 I shake a cup of ice at a friend I see twice a year (hello [@classidied](https://github.com/classidied)) so I decided rather than obtaining a cup of ice each time I see her, I might as well make an app that serves the same purpose. *Shake your phone with this app open to obtain ice shaking sounds*

 Note: Make sure your phone isn't on silent and notification sounds are up
